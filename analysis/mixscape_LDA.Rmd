This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



```{r}
# subset data to only include KO and control data
sub <- subset(dataSinglet, subset = mixscape_class.global %in% c("KO","control"))

pc_num <- sub$feature_gene %>% unique() %>% length()

# Run LDA.
sub <- MixscapeLDA(
  object = sub, 
  assay = "RNA", 
  pc.assay = "PRTB", 
  labels = "feature_gene", 
  nt.label = "control", 
  npcs = pc_num, 
  logfc.threshold = 0.25, 
  verbose = F)

# Use LDA results to run UMAP and visualize cells on 2-D. 
# Here, we note that the number of the dimensions to be used is equal to the number of 
# labels minus one (to account for NT cells).
sub <- RunUMAP(
  object = sub,
  dims = 1:(pc_num-1),
  reduction = 'lda',
  reduction.key = 'ldaumap_',
  reduction.name = 'ldaumap')
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=10}
# Visualize UMAP clustering results.
Idents(sub) <- "feature_gene"
sub$feature_gene <- as.factor(sub$feature_gene)

p1 <- DimPlot(sub, reduction = "lda") + theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
p2 <- DimPlot(sub, reduction = "ldaumap") + theme(aspect.ratio = 1)

p1+p2
```
