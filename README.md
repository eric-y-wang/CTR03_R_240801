# CTR03_R_240801

### Goal
* Test higher number of transferred Tregs with low MOI
* Ensure absence of weird cells in data
* Optimize presence of single sgRNA integrations
* Compare doublet detection with sgRNA vs HTO
* Test computational analysis with higher number of sgRNA targets

### Summary
RV transduction was performed using the subpool CRISPR library. 3e6/mL Tregs transferred r.o. per mouse. Groups consist of all mice from one cage.
